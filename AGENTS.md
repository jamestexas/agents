# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a Codex agent definitions repository containing specialized AI agents that extend Codex's capabilities. The repository contains no executable code - only agent definition files in Markdown format with YAML frontmatter.

## Agent Development Workflow

### Testing Agents Locally
```bash
# Copy agent to user directory for testing
cp agent-name.md ~/.Codex/agents/

# Or copy to project directory
cp agent-name.md /path/to/project/.Codex/agents/
```

### Creating New Agents

1. **File Naming**: Use kebab-case (e.g., `code-performance-optimizer.md`)
2. **Required Frontmatter Fields**:
   - `name`: Must match filename without extension
   - `description`: Include XML-formatted usage examples
   - `model`: Usually `inherit`, use `opus` for complex reasoning
   - `color`: Choose from blue, green, purple, red, orange

3. **Agent Persona Guidelines**:
   - Create compelling backstory that reinforces expertise
   - Define clear methodology and process
   - Structure output format for consistency
   - Include specific technical focus areas

### Quality Standards

- **Description**: Must include at least 2 detailed usage examples in XML format
- **Persona**: Should establish credibility and unique perspective
- **Process**: Define structured approach with numbered steps
- **Output**: Specify format for agent responses

├── *.md                    # Agent definition files
├── README.md              # Public documentation

└── .Codex/               # Codex configuration
    └── settings.local.json # Local permissions
```

## Git Workflow

When committing agent definitions:
- Use semantic commit messages (feat: for new agents, fix: for corrections, docs: for documentation)
- Test agents thoroughly before committing
- Update README.md when adding new agents

## Agent Architecture

Each agent file has two parts:
1. **YAML Frontmatter**: Metadata and configuration
2. **System Prompt**: Defines persona, expertise, and behavior

The agents inherit all tools and capabilities from the parent Codex session, so focus on domain expertise rather than tool usage.

## Common Tasks

### Add a new agent
1. Create new `.md` file with kebab-case name
2. Add YAML frontmatter with required fields
3. Write comprehensive system prompt
4. Test locally before committing
5. Update README.md with agent information

### Modify existing agent
1. Edit the agent's `.md` file
2. Test changes locally
3. Commit with descriptive message

### Share agents with team
```bash
# Push to GitHub
git add *.md
git commit -m "feat: add new agent for X"
git push

# Team members can then clone and install
```

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
